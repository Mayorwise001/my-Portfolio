            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a full-stack web developer with a passion for building visually stunning and highly functional applications.My interest in web development began at the age of 14 when I created a blog that eventually grew to attract over 80,000 followers. Since then, I've been dedicated to expanding my knowledge and remain eager to learn.
When I'm not coding I'm probably at the gym or hanging out with my cat.ðŸ˜¸</p>
