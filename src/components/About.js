            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a full-stack web developer with a passion for building visually stunning and highly functional applications.</p>
                
                <p>My interest in web development began after learning how to design websites with the use of Wordpress. I have created so many astonishing websites for various companies and clients. Since then, I've been dedicated to expanding my knowledge and remain eager to learn.</p>
               
<p>When I'm not coding I'm probably playing the piano or hanging out with my family.</p>
